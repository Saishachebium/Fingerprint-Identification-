# Fingerprint-Identification-
This project identifies whether a user’s fingerprint matches an existing record. It uses algorithms such as the Zhang–Suen thinning algorithm and recursive logic to analyze ridge patterns and compare them against stored data.

The accuracy of fingerprint identification depends on many external factors, including:

 Webcam or scanner quality – higher resolution leads to clearer ridge detection

Lighting conditions – shadows or glare can distort fingerprint images

Finger positioning – rotation or shifting of the finger may affect matching results

Ridge clarity – smudges, dryness, or excessive pressure can reduce accuracy

By considering these limitations, this project demonstrates both the potential and challenges of fingerprint-based biometric systems.
